Added alt tags (7) describing the seven image elements 
4 are .png elements 3 are .jpg elements
6 alt tags were appended to the six <img> lines in the html document
1 alt tag was appended to tne <img> line for the background element in the CSS style sheet
The task was to provide an alt tag description intended for screen readers to specify an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed.
Alternatively, the alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
The challenge is to provide enough description for the image in the UI as to approximate the UX if the user eencountered an image.
